// Book slot with post request
// assign team to user
// logic: check slot's team1 and team2's user count
// assign to the team having lowest user
// or in case of equal assign to team1 directly

// Cancel slot with patch request
// remove the user from that team
// if current time is greater than 6 hours then only he can cancel the booking.
// if current time is greater then 12 hours then only complete refund else 50% deduction.
// update the status as cancelled.
